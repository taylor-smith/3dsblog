#MakerSquare Students Launch Company at 3 Day Startup

*This is a guest post by MakerSquare fellows [Taylor Smith](twitter.com/taylorcodes), [Clay Stewart](twitter.com/clay_Stewart), and [Gamble McAdam](twitter.com/misplacedyankee).*

While the three of us were MakerSquare students, we were approached with the opportunity to participate in a [3 Day Startup](http://3daystartup.org/), an intensive weekend workshop where participants attempt to develop a business idea and launch it in one weekend. Heavy emphasis is placed on validating a product-market fit and making sure that people actually want the product that you are creating.

We could see no better opportunity to put the skills that we were learning at [MakerSquare](themakersquare.com) to the test than to see if we could successfully build and launch a web product in one weekend. In lieu of a MakerSquare hackathon, we opted to participate in 3 Day Startup.

The three of us each had a business idea that we planned to pitch at 3 Day Startup; Gamble wanted to build a music collaboration service, Clay had a prototype of a bookmarking and link sharing engine, and Taylor had a prototype for a Kickstarter-like event planning app. When we arrived, we were split into different groups of six in order to discuss ideas and see who would move onto the next round of selection. This round would consist of pitching the idea to the entirety of 3 Day Startup, who would then vote on ideas and self-select into groups.

When the dust had settled, only Taylor's idea moved forward to the next round, and was ultimately selected by the group to be one of the 3 Day Startup businesses. [Eventstarter](eventstarter.co) would get a shot to become a business.

A diverse group of students, including a McCombs MBA student, a University of Texas Masters of Accounting student, an electrical engineer, and a student getting her Masters in Architecture, joined the project. We began forming a plan for validating this business idea as 3 Day Startup volunteers grilled us on our business plan and marketing strategy.

The next day, we embarked on our quest to validate Eventstarter's market with high hopes. A sobering realization occured throughout the day as we found that nobody wanted to pay money for our service, and our idea did not truly solve the pain point of people flaking on their plans and commitments.

After attempting (and failing) to pivot to a business-to-business model, we went back to 3 Day Startup with our tails between our legs. We had nothing to show for a hard day's work of talking to customers.

After receiving a much needed butt-kicking from our 3DS mentors, we set back to work as we tried to find a business that peoplea actually wanted to pay money for. We brainstormed and dialed countless numbers of friends as we sought for market validation for our crazy schemes. After a few hours, we finally decided upon something we thought we could make work: a matching site for tennis players seeking opponents of a suitable skill level.

Renewed by a sense of purpose and direction, it was left to the three developers to actually build the product. We stayed up all night (or, more accurately, Clay beast-moded the app while Taylor slept under the desk), but eventually we had a working MVP, [MatchSetter](matchsetter.herokuapp.com). The rest of the team arrived later that morning and we quickly got to work calling tennis clubs to verify that our idea was something that they would actually pay for.

Ready or not, we had to pitch MatchSetter to actual investors later that evening. We worked with the designer on our team to make the app look more beautiful while the business-minded folks set to work creating a pitch deck. We eventually gave a successful pitch and won the Phoenix Award (team that most successfully rises from the ashes) from the 3 Day Startup team.

Overall, we learned a tremendous amount from our 3 Day Startup experience. As developers, we are more likely to go ahead and build something without actually checking to see if there are people out there who would use our product. Going through the process of leaving the building and talking to potential customers was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and ultimately we discovered that our first idea was not viable and were able to switch to a more promising business model.

3 Day Startup's great team of advisors and mentors helped us connect the dots between developing applications and making money. As developers, we must be cognizant of not only the technological challenges facing us but also of the sales and business challenges that confront any business idea. 3 Day Startup complimented our MakerSquare experience perfectly, and we cannot wait to participate in or advise a future event.
