#MakerSquare Students Launch Company at 3 Day Startup

While the three of us were MakerSquare students, we were approached with the opportunity to participate in a [3 Day Startup](http://3daystartup.org/), an intensive weekend workshop where participants attempt to develop a business idea and launch it in one weekend. Heavy emphasis is placed on validating a product-market fit and making sure that people actually want the product that you are creating.

We could see no better opportunity to put the skills that we were learning at [MakerSquare](themakersquare.com) to the test than to see if we could successfully build and launch a web product in one weekend. In lieu of a MakerSquare hackathon, we opted to participate in 3 Day Startup.

The three of us each had a business idea that we planned to pitch at 3 Day Startup; Gamble wanted to build a music collaboration service, Clay had a prototype of a bookmarking and link sharing engine, and Taylor had a prototype for a Kickstarter-like event planning app. When we arrived, we were split into different groups of six in order to discuss ideas and see who would move onto the next round of selection. This round would consist of pitching the idea to the entirety of 3 Day Startup, who would then vote on ideas and self-select into groups.

When the dust had settled, only Taylor's idea moved forward to the next round, and was ultimately selected by the group to be one of the 3 Day Startup businesses. [Eventstarter](eventstarter.co) would get a shot to become a business.

A diverse group of students, including a McCombs MBA student, a University of Texas Masters of Accounting student, an electrical engineer, and a student getting her Masters in Architecture, joined the project. We began forming a plan for validating this business idea as 3 Day Startup volunteers grilled us on our business plan and marketing strategy.

The next day, we embarked on our quest to validate Eventstarter's market with high hopes. A sobering realization occured throughout the day as we found that nobody wanted to pay money for our service, and our idea did not truly solve the pain point of people flaking on their plans and commitments.

After attempting (and failing) to pivot to a business-to-business model, we went back to 3 Day Startup with our tails between our legs. We had nothing to show for a hard day's work of talking to customers.

After receiving a much needed butt-kicking from our 3DS mentors, we set back to work as we tried to find a business that peoplea actually wanted to pay money for. We brainstormed and dialed countless numbers of friends as we sought for market validation for our crazy schemes. After a few hours, we finally decided upon something we thought we could make work: a matching site for tennis players seeking opponents of a suitable skill level.

Renewed by a sense of purpose and direction, it was left to the three developers to actually build the product. We stayed up all night, but eventually we had a working MVP, [MatchSetter](matchsetter.herokuapp.com).
